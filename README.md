# Digits-Classification
This project uses machine learning-based models to deal with handwriting digits. Furthermore, there is hounded research into the machine learning approaches for classifying / clustering Digits. 

One of the most important portions is; that the project provides one dataset which classifies with different machine learning models.

This project used models are LogisticRegression, Random Forests Classifier, and KNN Classifier.
Moreover, using different Machine Learning models. It Visualizes the relationship between features with validation_curve and learning curve:

The only base which wants to classify digits is:  digits can extract the predicted class by identifying which class had the highest probability in the SoftMax layer.
